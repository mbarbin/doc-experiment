This is a toy project that I use to experiment with documentation
tools. In particular I'd like to see if I can get a doc hosting
platform such as readthedocs.io to be built using markdown files with
mdx enabled, and including OCaml libraries API documentation.

This is work in progress. If I like the result, I may go ahead and
reuse that setup in other projects.
