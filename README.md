This is a toy project that I use to experiment with documentation
tools. In particular I'd like to see if I can get a doc hosted on
github pages (or a platform such as readthedocs.io), which would be
built using markdown files with mdx enabled, including OCaml libraries
API documentation (odoc).

This is work in progress. If I like the result, I may go ahead and
reuse that setup in other projects.
